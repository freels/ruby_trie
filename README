A trie data structure implementation for ruby. Currently, it's a pretty minimal implementation. I've only implemented Trie#[], Trie#[]=, and Trie#delete so far. It's also fairly naive: There's plenty of room for optimization I'm sure, especially in key character sibling storage. (Currently a just linked list.) However, it does manage to be a bit faster than a native ruby Hash for similar keys.

== Usage

Compile the extension:

ruby extconf.rb
make

Code:

require 'trie'

t = Trie.new
t["key"] = "value"
t["key"]            # => "value"

== Bugs

I'm sure there are plenty!
